## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite Apps
- **Discord**  
  - Instantly join video calls without hassle
  - In-app previews for images, videos, and links

- **Premier League App**  
  - Leaderboards for bragging rights  
  - Quick access to player stats

- **Checker App**  
  - Habit tracking styled like GitHub's commit calendar  
  - Encouraging animations for daily check-ins

### App Idea
Create an app focused on helping students—middle school through college—navigate the often-hidden challenges of financial aid and college expenses. Inspired by personal experiences, the app would educate users on common issues, provide real-life “financial aid journeys” similar to LinkedIn-style histories, and offer a space to anonymously share stories.

The app could also guide users in preparing for unexpected college costs (travel, health/dental insurance, etc.) and inspire creative approaches to funding their education, such as fellowships, fundraising, or entrepreneurship.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I faced a Git issue when placing the project inside an existing Swift learning repository that already had an initialized `.git` folder. This led to some commit and repo structure complications.
