## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite Apps
- Discord
- Premier League App
- Checker App

Features that I love:
Discord --> The ability to join a video call instantaneously without having to go through the hassle of sending a meeting link.
Discord --> I love how images, videos, and links load in the app so that you can get a preview. YouTube videos can even play. This means I don't have to open another app when someone sends me a funny tiktok.

Premier League App --> The leaderboards for sure! You get to have braging rights over all of your friends. 
Premier League App --> Stats! I love being able to quickly glance at the stats of my favorite players.

Checker App --> This is an app made by a solo dev I watch on YouTube. He created an app that allows you to create habits and check them off... The coolest part is that it looks like you Github commit calendar!
Checker App --> I love the encouraging animation that occurs when you 'check-in' for the day on one of your habits.

### App Idea
App Premise: Create an app that middle school, highschool, and college students can use related to the "unspoken" realities of college. This idea came about from my experiences of having to pester financial aid on a monthly basis to get scholarships processed, aid released, and clarity on billing. No one ever tells you some of the 'sneaky' shortcomings of our financial aid system. I want to create an app that educates students on this. 

Additionally, I want to open the app to people who have already been through college or are currently in college so that they can share their 'financial aid journey'. Similar to how you can you see someone's work history on LinkedIn, I want students to see how people paid for college over the course of 4-5 years. People could do this anonymously if they're uncomfortable with people knowing how much they received in scholarships or loans etc. So often, people are like, "just apply to scholarships". But the reality is, there are millions of students applying for the same scholarships on Fastweb, Unigo etc. You have to get creative with how you pay for school: fundraising, fellowships, work, starting a business. I want to inspire students to prepare for college in creative ways. 

Lastly, I want to help students and families start saving for unforseen expeneses related to college that you never think about. For example: plane tickets (I'm from the mid-west but I go to school on the east coast), health insurance, dental insurance (not included in health insurance which is dumb), etc etc. I want to create a roadmap for students to start saving and thinking about the future expenses.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was putting my app in a Git Repository I already made for my Swift Learning. There were some issues with making a commit with a .git repository within an already initialized repo.
